# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

## Purpose

This README serves as the entry point for OctoAcme's project management documentation. It provides a comprehensive guide to our processes, roles, and best practices for delivering successful projects.

## Overview

OctoAcme's project management approach is designed to deliver customer value through iterative, data-informed delivery with clear ownership and psychological safety. Our process encompasses the complete project lifecycle from initial concept through continuous improvement.

**Project Initiation**: Every project begins with a clear problem statement and measurable outcomes. We validate business needs, identify stakeholders and champions, and create a lightweight project one-pager that defines success criteria, initial timelines, and resource requirements. This phase ensures alignment before committing significant resources.

**Planning and Execution**: Once approved, projects move into detailed planning where we break work into shippable increments, identify dependencies, and create a prioritized backlog with clear acceptance criteria. During execution, cross-functional teams (Project Managers, Product Managers, Developers, and QA) collaborate using defined workflows with daily standups, weekly syncs, and regular demos. Our pull request processes emphasize small, reviewable changes with automated testing and security scanning in CI.

**Risk Management and Communication**: Throughout the project lifecycle, we maintain a risk register tracking impact, likelihood, and mitigation strategies. Stakeholder communication follows a structured cadence with weekly status updates and clear escalation paths. Our communication templates ensure consistency and transparency across all project phases.

**Release and Continuous Improvement**: Projects conclude with structured releases following our deployment checklist, comprehensive release notes, and rollback plans. Every sprint, release, or significant milestone triggers a retrospective where we capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements tracked in our backlog.

## Process at a Glance

Our project management process consists of the following key phases:

- **Initiation**: Define problem statement, stakeholders, success metrics, and high-level timeline
- **Planning**: Create prioritized backlog, estimate scope, identify dependencies, and establish Definition of Done
- **Execution & Tracking**: Daily standups, weekly syncs, PR workflows, quality assurance, and progress monitoring
- **Risk & Communication**: Maintain risk register, provide regular stakeholder updates, and manage escalations
- **Release & Deployment**: Follow deployment checklist, create release notes, and implement rollback plans
- **Retrospective**: Capture learnings, identify improvements, and track action items
- **Roles & Personas**: Project Managers, Product Managers, Developers, QA, and Stakeholders with defined responsibilities
